This project consists of an analysis of NBA player data from the 2024-2025 season. In this analysis, I have chosen 5 predictors to determine what best predicts player efficiency, and which model helps me to predict the best. Attached in this repository is the code that I used in R, demonstrating all of the work for the project. The nba_dashboard image provides a breakdown of my 5 predictors. Points, rebounds, assists, position, and free throw attempts are all taken into consideration, with all of them compared to player efficency (EFF).
The RMSE, MAE, and Rsquared plots all showcase the different models that I trained with 5-fold cross validation. I chose to use a full linear model, a linear model subset, a random forest model, a k-NN model, and a tree model to see which one would help me best predict player efficiency. The Results_plot, also attached, shows all of these methods compared side by side for a better analysis of the results, ultimately showing that the linear models best predict efficiency.
